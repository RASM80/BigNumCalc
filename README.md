# BigNumCalc
a C++-based calculator designed to handle numbers of any size, breaking free from the constraints of standard calculators.


### Project Overview: 

As part of a university programming course, I developed a C++ calculator designed to handle arithmetic operations on very large numbers, surpassing the limitations of standard data types. This project, crafted during my early days of programming, utilizes string manipulation to represent and compute with arbitrary-precision numbers. 
It supports essential operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—through custom algorithms that process numbers digit by digit. Given its origins in my initial learning phase, the code may lack the polish of more refined solutions, yet it effectively demonstrates my foundational grasp of programming concepts and problem-solving techniques applied to real computational challenges.
